# Why

The doc chunking methods matter in RAG-based workflow. It is like the famous saying in machine learning community: "Garbage in garbage out". We need to make sure the chunking methods split docs into semantically independent units.

# Notes
Remember to use the default split_doc function in data_set.py

After rag exp, remember to recover the original split_doc function in each dataset.
